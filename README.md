# Booking-system
This is a simple booking system written in "C" language that creates a data structure for clients and uses that to add, delete, edit, and view clients' data.  
I used a doubly linked list (DLL) for my data structure.  
The program contains four files:    
>                       1- stdtype.h: This is for the standard types used in the program.  
>			2- header.h: contains the data structures definition and the prototypes of my functions.  
>			3- functions.c: contains the functions of the program.  
>			4- main.c: The main function and how the program is implemented
